    "problem": "Deploying a static portfolio website traditionally requires managing servers, configuring web servers, and handling scaling concerns. I wanted to build a production-ready static site that demonstrates cloud infrastructure knowledge while being cost-effective and scalable.",
    "architecture": "This portfolio is a pure static website hosted on AWS S3 with static website hosting enabled. The architecture leverages S3's durability and scalability, with CloudFront CDN (optional) for global distribution. All assets are served directly from S3 buckets, eliminating the need for compute resources. The site uses vanilla JavaScript to dynamically load project data from a JSON file, making it easy to add new projects without modifying HTML.",
